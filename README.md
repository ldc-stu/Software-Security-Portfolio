# Software-Security-Portfolio
-----------------------------

    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    
 Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that offers individualized financial plans and had hired us for the development of a web based application with the appropriate security measures for the financial data/sensitive customer information to be applied correctly.    
 
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
    
Vulnerabilities are found through static testing in the programs code. Without this, the data involved with our code is at a security risk. Along with checksum verification, we can improve the integrity of a file so it does not hurt the company's reputation.  
    
    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
    
The heavy lifting of detecting vulnerabilities is done by the dependency check tool but managing false detections and the prioritizing of vulnerabilities is something I was struggling with. 
    
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    
Other than compiling and running the program for testing purposes, I feel that a simulated penetration test can mitigate more security risks. 
    
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    
Manual code review, along with the usual compiling and testing, can establish better functionality but you should always run dependency checks again in any new additions. 
    
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    
Simple google searches to a specific problem faced can be very effective and reviewing similar projects to your own can be valuable in finding a blueprint for your work. 
    
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    
A showcase of understanding and fufilling requirements with mitigation techniques paired with proper adaptability in your own code for the future development of your application can bring value to the table long after you cross the finish line.
